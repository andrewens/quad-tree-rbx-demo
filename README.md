# quad-tree-rbx-demo
Interact with a quadtree data structure in a ROBLOX experience. Quadtrees are used for optimized spatial queries of points. I developed this to make a Barnes-Hut gravity simulation as research for my new game, Ship Crew RPG.

ROBLOX place:

The ROBLOX place is uncopylocked, so you can clone it and edit it yourself. You can also just hit 'play'.
